# Experiments

Welcome to **Experiments**! 

This repository is a collection of various experiments to test ``miscellaneous'' research ideas on the small scale for the 
sake of understanding or reproducing others' results. Also included are code snippets for various fun problems and/or helper functions for repetitive
development tasks.

In the future, I will go through and make this more organized, but for now, just think of it as almost a "miscellaneous box of programs" ranging
from research projects to a music visualizer to a simulator of a solution to the classic "prisoners with hats" logic puzzle. Included are also
some projects now made obsolete by ChatGPT, such as the "GrammarlyLatex" folder.
